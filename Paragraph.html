    <pre><p> A <b>paragraph</b> is defined as “a group of <i>sentences</i> or a <u>single sentence</u> that forms a unit” (Lunsford and Connors 116). 
Length and appearance do not determine whether a section in a paper is a paragraph. 
For instance, in some styles of writing, particularly journalistic styles, a paragraph can be just one sentence long.</p> </pre>
